          <a href="" class="link">Mickey Mouse</a> would have to be the main
          figure. Yet some mention must be made of our great animated classics.
          I made sketches of all the characters I thought should appear. Then, I
          called upon my modeling skills to build a one-16th-inch scale paper
          cut-out model of what I wanted. This was before photo-copying machines
          with reducing capabilities, so I had to make all the drawings in
          scale. Many of the figures had to be drawn, a quarter-inch high. The
          entire set was about 18-inches long by 3.5-inches high. But this model
          was a good tool for planning the show sequence and experimenting with
          different scenes.
